# ftc-pi-bridge

Upload FTC robot code from a Mac **while the Mac's Wi-Fi stays on the internet**.

```
Mac ──USB──► Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W ──Wi-Fi──► Control Hub
     adb connect 10.12.194.1:5555
```

> Not yet tested end-to-end with a Control Hub.

## Parts
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (a Pi 4 or Pi 5 also works, through its USB-C port; the Pi 5 also has 5 GHz Wi-Fi)
- microSD card, 16–32 GB
- USB-C to micro-USB **data** cable (charge-only cables won't work)

## Setup (once)
1. `./install.sh`: builds the menu bar app, installs the `ftc-bridge` command, and adds the AI tools to Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode and the Claude desktop app if you have them (it asks first).
2. `brew install --cask raspberry-pi-imager`
3. Put the SD card in the Mac and run `./flash.sh`. Type which disk to erase.
4. Put the card in the Pi. Plug the Pi's **middle** micro-USB port (labelled USB, not PWR) into the Mac. Wait ~3 minutes the first time.
5. Save your robots: in the menu bar app, **Add robot**, pick your robot from the list, type its Wi-Fi password, **Save & Connect**. Or in the terminal: `ftc-bridge add comp 12345-RC` (asks for the password).

## Windows
Teammates on Windows can use the Pi too, from a terminal and AI apps (there's no tray app; the SD card is made on a Mac).
1. Install Android Studio, and Raspberry Pi's USB driver: `rpi-usb-gadget-driver-setup.exe` from the [rpi-usb-gadget releases](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-usb-gadget/releases).
2. In the repo folder: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File windows\install.ps1`. It puts `ftc-bridge` on your PATH, adds the AI tools, and makes this PC's key.
3. The Pi only lets in computers it knows. The installer copies this PC's key; whoever set up the Pi runs `ftc-bridge add-key "<that key>"` once, with the Pi plugged in.
4. Then the same `ftc-bridge` commands work, e.g. `ftc-bridge status`, `ftc-bridge upload comp`.

Don't turn on Internet Connection Sharing for the Pi.

## Linux
Linux computers can use the same Raspberry Pi USB bridge and `ftc-bridge` commands (CLI and MCP; no desktop app). Prepare the Pi SD card using Connor's macOS `flash.sh`, then on Linux run `bash linux/install.sh`. See [Linux setup](linux/README.md) for USB networking and SSH key authorization.

## Every time
1. Plug in the Pi and turn on the robot. The menu bar icon shows radio waves when it's connected.
2. In Android Studio, pick the Control Hub and press Run. The app connects adb for you (without the app: `adb connect 10.12.194.1:5555`).

**Different robot?** Click it in the menu bar app, or `ftc-bridge use practice`.

## Menu bar app
| Icon | Meaning |
|---|---|
| radio waves | Connected to the robot |
| radio waves, crossed out | Pi plugged in, robot not reachable (robot off, or none chosen) |
| plug | Pi not plugged in |

The **Health** card shows the Wi-Fi signal and channel, whether the robot app and adb answer, whether it's the same hub this robot had before (so you don't upload to the wrong robot), and a **Test** button for the real upload speed.

While it's open, the app records the robot's log to `~/Library/Logs/ftc-bridge/robot.log`, so the log commands and AI tools read it instantly, and uploads add a marker so "everything since the last upload" is one command.

If robot code throws, freezes, or crashes the app, you get a notification with the error and the line in your code, and a **Copy error** button for pasting into an AI chat.

**Open Panels** opens the robot's Panels dashboard (telemetry, graphs, OpMode control, Limelight) in your browser at `http://localhost:8001`, through the Pi. The robot code needs Panels.

The ⚙ button has settings (open at login, robot name in the menu bar, connect Android Studio, notifications, crash alerts), **Back up robot**, and Pi controls: **Disconnect from robot**, **Restart Pi**, **Shut down Pi**.

## Robot data (BridgeLog)
Copy `robot/BridgeLog.java` into your `TeamCode` folder (in `org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode`). From then on every OpMode run is recorded on the robot by itself, 25 times a second, as one CSV per run: time, init/run phase, each motor's power, position and velocity, battery voltage, and a goBILDA Pinpoint's position and heading if you have one. Add anything else with one line in your loop, e.g. `BridgeLog.put("aimError", error);`.

```
ftc-bridge data                     list runs on the robot
ftc-bridge data pull                copy the newest run to this computer (about a second)
ftc-bridge data summary             min / max / mean of every column, and how long it ran
```
AI tools: `robot_data_runs`, `robot_data_summary`, `robot_data_rows` (pick columns and a time window).

It reads the hubs with its own bulk reads, so it doesn't change what your OpMode reads, but it does add some hub traffic: set `BridgeLog.hz` lower, or `BridgeLog.enabled = false`, if your loop timing matters more.

## Terminal command (for you or an AI agent)
```

ftc-bridge adb ARGS...          any adb command, sent to the robot through the Pi
```
An agent passes the password on stdin, so it isn't in the command line:
`printf '%s\n' 'the-password' | ftc-bridge add comp 12345-RC`

## AI apps (MCP)
`mcp/server.py` gives AI apps these tools: `status`, `health`, `list_robots`, `scan`, `use_robot`, `upload`, `run_tests`, `logs`, `search_logs`, `mark_log`, `crashes`, `speed_test`, `backup`, `list_backups`, `restore_backup`, `open_panels`, `open_tuning`, `read_telemetry` (live Panels values), `robot_data_runs`, `robot_data_summary`, `robot_data_rows`, `pi_log`, `update_pi`, `disconnect`. `install.sh` sets it up; to do it by hand, it needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (`brew install uv`):

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user ftc-bridge -- uv run /path/to/ftc-pi-bridge/mcp/server.py
```

**Claude desktop app:** add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, then restart the app:
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "ftc-bridge": { "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/uv", "args": ["run", "/path/to/ftc-pi-bridge/mcp/server.py"] } } }
```

**Codex:** add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:
```toml
[mcp_servers.ftc-bridge]
command = "uv"
args = ["run", "/path/to/ftc-pi-bridge/mcp/server.py"]
```

Paste this into your robot repo's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`:
> To upload robot code: run `ftc-bridge robots` and make sure you know which robot the user means (ask if unclear). Then run `ftc-bridge upload <name>` from the project root. If it fails, run `ftc-bridge status` and report what it says.

## Updating
`git pull`, then `./install.sh` (rebuilds the app). If the Pi's software changed, the app shows **Update the Pi**; one click updates it over USB, no reflashing.

## Things to know
- **On a Pi Zero 2 W, the robot must be on 2.4 GHz.** It can't see 5 GHz. Control Hubs ship on 2.4 GHz, but events may ask you to use 5 GHz; there, use the normal USB cable.
- **Before a match, disconnect the Pi** (⚙ → Disconnect from robot, `ftc-bridge disconnect`, or unplug it). Rule R704.C: only the Driver Station may be on the robot's Wi-Fi during a match.
- **Shut down the Pi before unplugging it** (⚙ → Shut down Pi) to protect the SD card.
- **Don't turn on macOS Internet Sharing for the Pi.** The Pi changes its address when you do.
- **The USB link can go dead by itself** (seen with a Mac after 10-25 minutes: the Pi keeps running, but the computer can't reach it until the cable is pulled). The Pi now catches that: it re-plugs the link in software, then again, and if the computer still isn't back it restarts itself, like pulling the cable. Back within about 1-3 minutes. The app tells you: **The Pi stopped answering**, then **The Pi is back**. `ftc-bridge pi-log` shows how often it happened and what it took.
- **Debugging the Pi:** `ssh -i ~/.ssh/ftcpi ftc@10.12.194.1`. The app's own log (the Pi coming and going, notifications sent) is `~/Library/Logs/ftc-bridge/app.log`.
